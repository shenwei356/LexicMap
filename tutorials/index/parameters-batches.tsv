**`-b/--batch-size`**	Max: 131072, default: 5000	Maximum number of genomes in each batch	If the number of input files exceeds this number, input files are split into multiple batches and indexes are built for all batches. In the end, seed files are merged, while genome data files are kept unchanged and collected. â–  Bigger values increase indexing memory occupation and increase batch searching speed, while single query searching speed is not affected.
