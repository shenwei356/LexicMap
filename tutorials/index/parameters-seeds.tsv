Flag	Value	Function	Comment
**`--seed-max-desert`**	Default: 450	Maximum length of distances between seeds	The default value of 450 guarantees queries >450 bp would match at least one seed. ► Large regions with no seeds are called sketching deserts. Deserts with seed distance larger than this value will be filled by choosing k-mers roughly every --seed-in-desert-dist (150 by default) bases. ■ Smaller values improve the search sensitivity, slow down the indexing speed, increase the indexing memory occupation and increase the index size.
`-c/--chunks`	Maximum: 128, default: #CPUs	Number of seed file chunks	Bigger values accelerate the search speed at the cost of a high disk reading load. The maximum number should not exceed the maximum number of open files set by the operating systems.
**`-J/--seed-data-threads`**	Maximum: -c/--chunks, default: 8	Number of threads for writing seed data and merging seed chunks from all batches	■ Bigger values increase indexing speed at the cost of slightly higher memory occupation.
`-p/--partitions`	Default: 512	Number of partitions for indexing each seed file	Bigger values bring a little higher memory occupation. 512 is a good value with high searching speed, larger or smaller values would decrease the speed in `lexicmap search`. ► After indexing, `lexicmap utils reindex-seeds` can be used to reindex the seeds data with  another value of this flag.
`--max-open-files`	Default: 512	Maximum number of open files	It's only used in merging indexes of multiple genome batches.
