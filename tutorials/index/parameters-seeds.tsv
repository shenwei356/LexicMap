Flag	Value	Function	Comment
**`--seed-max-desert`**	Default: 200	Maximum length of distances between seeds	The default value of 200 guarantees queries >200 bp would match at least one seed. ► Large regions with no seeds are called sketching deserts. Deserts with seed distance larger than this value will be filled by choosing k-mers roughly every --seed-in-desert-dist (50 by default) bases. ■ Bigger values decrease the search sensitivity for distant targets, speed up the indexing speed, decrease the indexing memory occupation and decrease the index size. While the alignment speed is almost not affected.
**`-c/--chunks`**	Maximum: 128, default: value of -j/--threads	Number of seed file chunks	Bigger values accelerate the search speed at the cost of a high disk reading load. ► The value should not exceed the maximum number of open files set by the operating systems. ► Make sure the value of `-j/--threads` in `lexicmap search` is >= this value.
**`-J/--seed-data-threads`**	Maximum: -c/--chunks, default: 8	Number of threads for writing seed data and merging seed chunks from all batches	■ Bigger values increase indexing speed at the cost of slightly higher memory occupation.
`-p/--partitions`	Default: 1024	Number of partitions for indexing each seed file	Bigger values bring a little higher memory occupation. ► After indexing, `lexicmap utils reindex-seeds` can be used to reindex the seeds data with  another value of this flag.
`--max-open-files`	Default: 512	Maximum number of open files	It's only used in merging indexes of multiple genome batches.
