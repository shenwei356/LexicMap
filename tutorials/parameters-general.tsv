Flag	Value	Function	Comment
**`-j/--threads`**	Default: all available cpus	Number of CPU cores to use.	The value should be >= the number of seed chunk files (“chunks” in info.toml, set by `-c/--chunks` in `lexicmap index`).
**`-w/--load-whole-seeds`**		Load the whole seed data into memory for faster search	Use this if the index is not big and many queries are needed to search.
**`-n/--top-n-genomes`**	Default 0, 0 for all	Keep top N genome matches for a query in the chaining phase	Value 1 is not recommended as the best chaining result does not always bring the best alignment, so it better be >= 5. The final number of genome hits might be smaller than this number as some chaining results might fail to pass the criteria in the alignment step.
**`-a/--all`**		Output more columns, e.g., matched sequences.	"Use this if you want to output blast-style format with ""lexicmap utils 2blast"""
-J/--max-query-conc 	Default 12, 0 for all	Maximum number of concurrent queries	Bigger values do not improve the batch searching speed and consume much memory.
