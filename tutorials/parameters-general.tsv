Flag	Value	Function	Comment
**`-w/--load-whole-seeds`**		Load the whole seed data into memory for faster search	Use this if the index is not big and many queries are needed to search.
**`-n/--top-n-genomes`**	Default 0, 0 for all	Keep top N genome matches for a query in the chaining phase	The final number of genome hits might be smaller than this number as some chaining results might fail to pass the criteria in the alignment step.
**`-a/--all`**		Output more columns, e.g., matched sequences.	"Use this if you want to output blast-style format with ""lexicmap utils 2blast"""
