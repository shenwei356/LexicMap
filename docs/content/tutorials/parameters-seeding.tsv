Flag	Value	Function	Comment
**`-p, --seed-min-prefix`**	Default 15	Minimum (prefix) length of matched seeds (anchors).	Smaller values produce more results at the cost of slow speed.
**`-P, --seed-min-single-prefix`**	Default 17	Minimum (prefix) length of matched seeds (anchors) if there's only one pair of seeds matched.	Smaller values produce more results at the cost of slow speed.
`--seed-max-dist`	Default 1000	Max distance between seeds in seed chaining. It should be <= contig interval length in database.	
`--seed-max-gap`	Default 50	Max gap in seed chaining.	
**`--top-n-chains`**	Default 0	Keep the top N chains in a genome for the query (0 for all) in the chaining phase	Set a non-zero value if you only need the most similar matches. Value 1 is not recommended as the best chaining result does not always bring the best alignment, so it better be >= 10.
