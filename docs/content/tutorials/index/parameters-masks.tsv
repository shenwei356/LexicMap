Flag	Value	Function	Comment
`-M/--mask-file`	A file	File with custom masks	"File with custom masks, which could be exported from an existing index or newly generated by ""lexicmap utils masks"". This flag oversides `-k/--kmer`, `-m/--masks`, `-s/--rand-seed`, etc."
**`-k/--kmer`**	Max: 32, default: 31	K-mer size	■ Bigger values improve the search specificity and do not increase the index size.
**`-m/--masks`**	Default: 20,000	Number of masks	■  Bigger values improve the search sensitivity, increase the index size, and slow down the search speed. For smaller genomes like phages/viruses, m=5,000 is high enough.
