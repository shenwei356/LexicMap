**`-b/--batch-size`**	Maximum: 131072, default: 10000	Maximum number of genomes in each batch	If the number of input files exceeds this number, input files are split into multiple batches and indexes are built for all batches. Next, seed files are merged into a big one, while genome data files are kept unchanged and collected. ► Bigger values increase indexing memory occupation.
